8.1 Obtain the names of all physicians that have performed a medical procedure they have never been certified to perform.

	select p.Name from Physician p
        inner join Undergoes u on p.EmployeeID = u.Physician
        left join Trained_In ti on u.Procedures = ti.Treatment and p.EmployeeID = ti.Physician
        where ti.Treatment IS NULL
        group by p.EmployeeID

8.2 Same as the previous query, but include the following information in the results: Physician name, name of procedure, date when the procedure was carried out, name of the patient the procedure was carried out on.

	select P.Name AS Physician, Pr.Name AS Procedures, U.Dateundergoes, Pt.Name AS Patient 
	from Physician P, Undergoes U, Patient Pt, Procedures Pr
	where U.Patient = Pt.SSN
	and U.Procedures = Pr.Code
	and U.Physician = P.EmployeeID
	and not exists 
	(
	   SELECT * FROM Trained_In T
	  WHERE T.Treatment = U.Procedures 
	  AND T.Physician = U.Physician
	);

8.3 Obtain the names of all physicians that have performed a medical procedure that they are certified to perform, but such that the procedure was done at a date (Undergoes.Date) after the physician's certification expired (Trained_In.CertificationExpires).

	select P.Name from Physician as P,Trained_In T,Undergoes as U
 	where T.Physician=U.Physician and T.Treatment=U.Procedures and U.Dateundergoes>T.CertificationExpires and P.EmployeeID=U.Physician

8.4 Same as the previous query, but include the following information in the results: Physician name, name of procedure, date when the procedure was carried out, name of the patient the procedure was carried out on, and date when the certification expired.

	select P.Name as Physician, Pr.Name as Procedures, U.Dateundergoes, Pt.Name as Patient, T.CertificationExpires
  	from Physician P, Undergoes U, Patient Pt, Procedures Pr, Trained_In T
  	where U.Patient = Pt.SSN
        and U.Procedures = Pr.Code
    	and U.Physician = P.EmployeeID
    	and Pr.Code = T.Treatment
    	and P.EmployeeID = T.Physician
    	and U.Dateundergoes > T.CertificationExpires;

8.5 Obtain the information for appointments where a patient met with a physician other than his/her primary care physician. Show the following information: Patient name, physician name, nurse name (if any), start and end time of appointment, examination room, and the name of the patient's primary care physician.

	select Pt.Name as Patient, Ph.Name as Physician, N.Name as Nurse, A.Start, A.End, A.ExaminationRoom, PhPCP.Name as PCP
  	from Patient Pt, Physician Ph, Physician PhPCP, Appointment A left join Nurse N on A.PrepNurse = N.EmployeeID
 	where A.Patient = Pt.SSN
   	and A.Physician = Ph.EmployeeID
   	and Pt.PCP = PhPCP.EmployeeID
   	and A.Physician <> Pt.PCP;

8.6 The Patient field in Undergoes is redundant, since we can obtain it from the Stay table. There are no constraints in force to prevent inconsistencies between these two tables. More specifically, the Undergoes table may include a row where the patient ID does not match the one we would obtain from the Stay table through the Undergoes.Stay foreign key. Select all rows from Undergoes that exhibit this inconsistency.

	select * from Undergoes U where Patient<>(select Patient from Stay S where U.Stay = S.StayID);

8.7 Obtain the names of all the nurses who have ever been on call for room 123.

	select N.Name from Nurse N
 	where EmployeeID IN
   	(
     	select OC.Nurse from On_Call OC, Room R
      	where OC.BlockFloor = R.BlockFloor
        and OC.BlockCode = R.BlockCode
        and R.RoomNumber = 123
   	);

8.8 The hospital has several examination rooms where appointments take place. Obtain the number of appointments that have taken place in each examination room.

	select examinationroom, count(appointmentiD) as Number from appointment group by examinationroom;

8.9 Obtain the names of all patients (also include, for each patient, the name of the patient's primary care physician), such that \emph{all} the following are true:
    -- The patient has been prescribed some medication by his/her primary care physician.
    -- The patient has undergone a procedure with a cost larger that $5,000
    -- The patient has had at least two appointment where the nurse who prepped the appointment was a registered nurse.
    -- The patient's primary care physician is not the head of any department.

	select Pt.Name, PhPCP.Name from Patient Pt, Physician PhPCP
 	where Pt.PCP = PhPCP.EmployeeID
   	and exists
       	(
         select * from Prescribes Pr
         where Pr.Patient = Pt.SSN
         and Pr.Physician = Pt.PCP
       	)
   	and exists
       	(
         select * from Undergoes U, Procedures Pr
         where U.Procedures = Pr.Code
         and U.Patient = Pt.SSN
         and Pr.Cost > 5000
       	)
   	and 2<=
       (
         select count(A.AppointmentID) from Appointment A, Nurse N
         where A.PrepNurse = N.EmployeeID
         and N.Registered = 1
         and A.Patient = Pt.SSN
       )
   	and not Pt.PCP in
       (
          select Head from Department
       );
