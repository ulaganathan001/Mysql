3.1 Select all warehouses.

	select * from warehouses;

3.2 Select all boxes with a value larger than $150.
	
   	select * from boxes where value>150;

3.3 Select all distinct contents in all the boxes.

	select distinct contents from boxes;

3.4 Select the average value of all the boxes.

	select avg(value) from boxes;

3.5 Select the warehouse code and the average value of the boxes in each warehouse.

	select w.code,avg(b.value) from warehouses w inner join boxes b on b.Warehouse=w.Code group by w.code;
    
3.6 Same as previous exercise, but select only those warehouses where the average value of the boxes is greater than 150.

	select w.code,avg(b.value) from warehouses w inner join boxes b on b.Warehouse=w.Code group by w.code having avg(b.value)>150;

3.7 Select the code of each box, along with the name of the city the box is located in.

	select b.code,w.location from  warehouses w inner join boxes b on b.Warehouse=w.Code;

3.8 Select the warehouse codes, along with the number of boxes in each warehouse. 

	select w.code,count(b.code) from  warehouses w inner join boxes b on b.Warehouse=w.Code group by w.code;

3.9 Select the codes of all warehouses that are saturated (a warehouse is saturated if the number of boxes in it is larger than the warehouse's capacity).

	select w.code ,count(b.code),w.Capacity from warehouses w join boxes b on b.Warehouse=w.Code group by b.Warehouse having count(b.code)>w.Capacity ;

3.10 Select the codes of all the boxes located in Chicago.

	select b.code from boxes b inner join warehouses w on w.code=b.warehouse where w.location='Chicago';

3.11 Create a new warehouse in New York with a capacity for 3 boxes.

	insert into warehouses values(6,'New York',3);

3.12 Create a new box, with code "H5RT", containing "Papers" with a value of $200, and located in warehouse 2.

	insert into boxes values('H5RT','Papers',200,2);

3.13 Reduce the value of all boxes by 15%.

	update boxes set value=value-value*15/100;

3.14 Remove all boxes with a value lower than $100.

	delete  from boxes where value<100;

3.15 Remove all boxes from saturated warehouses.

	delete from boxes where warehouse in (select w.code from warehouses w join (select count(*) as box_count,warehouse from boxes group by warehouse ) b on b.warehouse=w.code where b.box_count>w.capacity)

3.16 Add Index for column "Warehouse" in table "boxes"

    	create index warehouse on boxes(warehouse);

3.17 Print all the existing indexes

    	show indexes from boxes;
 
3.18 Remove (drop) the index you added just

    	alter table boxes drop index warehouse;
